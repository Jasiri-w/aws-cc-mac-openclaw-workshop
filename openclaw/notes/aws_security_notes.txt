# AWS Security & Best Practices Notes

## Key Security Concepts

### 1. IAM Roles & Permissions
- Always use IAM roles instead of hardcoding credentials
- Principle of least privilege: grant only necessary permissions
- Regular audit of role attachments and policies
- Never share access keys or root credentials

### 2. EC2 Instance Security
- Restrict SSH to specific IP addresses (not 0.0.0.0)
- Use security groups as a first layer of defense
- Enable VPC endpoints for private AWS service access
- Regularly patch and update instances

### 3. S3 Bucket Security
- Block public access by default
- Use bucket policies to restrict access to specific IAM roles
- Enable versioning for data recovery
- Monitor access with S3 access logs
- Use server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or KMS)

### 4. API Keys & Secrets
- Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store

### 5. Network Security
- Use VPN or bastion hosts for remote access
- Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) for public-facing apps
- Use NACLs and security groups layered approach

## Workshop-Specific Recommendations
- Create a separate AWS account for workshop environments
- Set up billing alerts to prevent unexpected charges
- Use temporary credentials with session tokens
- Clean up resources immediately after workshop completion
- Document all manual configurations for reproducibility
